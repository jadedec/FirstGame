After the time runs out, will show the result to the player.<br>
There is also a button "RESTART", click on that can restart the game.<br>
At the same time, this gameOver window will disappear.<br>

Game instructions: <br>
Choose the difficulty and click start, the coins will fall within 30 seconds <br>
Click on the coins to score, 10 points for easy, 20 points for hard, 30 points for superHard. <br>
The game ends after the countdown.<br>

For Players: <br>
The bigger the screen, the harder it will be. <br>
If you feel like the game is too easy, switch to a bigger screen.<br>

Developer Tips: <br>
Use MouseDown instead of Click for catching the coin, which is better.<br>
Create a cursor button for pointer on button.<br>

TODO: <br>
1.Check if the coin still exists in main, it maybe removed by click. <br>
Don't know how to check the existence for element now.<br>
Will report the error when JS want to delete the coin but the coin already deleted by click.<br>
This is not urgent, and can be fixed if change the top of coins into minus to hide them but it is not ideal.<br>
2.Check the cursor pattern
Want to use the pattern for main, but can't choose the difficulty anymore.
Check the radio input.
