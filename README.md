Game instructions:  
 Choose the difficulty and click start, the coins will fall within 30 seconds  
 Click on the coins to score, 10 points for easy, 20 points for hard, 30 points for superHard.  
 The game ends after the countdown.

For Players:  
The bigger the screen, the harder it will be.  
If you feel like the game is too easy, switch to a bigger screen.

Developer Tips:  
 use MouseDown instead of Click for catching the coin, which is better.

TODO:  
 check if the coin still exists in main, it maybe removed by click.  
 don't know how to check the existence for element now.
